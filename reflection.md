Reflection/ Self assessment

Confidence Check:
I actually feel quite confident about my HTML skills as it pertains to this class and what we have covered so far. At just two weeks in we have only covered very basic formatting, like we say in class just building the wooden frame of the house. Coming off of last semester creating an entire site for the capstone class this all feels quite familiar.

Learning Curve:
The learning curve for Git and Git-hub for me felt steep at first because I had never used Git-hub desktop, however once it was explained it is all very simple. I have used Git in the past to track changes on essays and some terminal writing but never for portfolio or website creation but the commit function serves the same purpose so I feel comfortable.

Problem Solving Growth:
Fortunately I have not found any problems so far. It may take me a bit to make sure I make the commits in the right place and remember to save before doing so, and I want to make sure I submit everything correctly. So barring that I have not run into any problems.

Professional Mindset:
It may feel like there is a little more pressure as I would not fully know what exactly an "professional" website looks like. I would also say I am not known for being artistically inclined so I worry about my ability to produce a perfect visually pleasing site in a professional manner.

Week 2 Reflection:
For me, my breakthrough moment was when Dr. Rode drew the process of "pushing" the committed changes into the repository on the little whiteboard. The visualization really helped me fully grasp the idea.

Looking Forward:
Going on in this class I really want to push myself in the creation of my site, and not just really on everything I already know/learned from the Capstone class. Having all those tricks is a great base but I want to add more "tools" to my ability in site creation with HTML.

Support and Resources:
I have been lucky to not run into any problems, but as for what has helped is how we go step by step in class and Dr. Rode has addressed any problems on the spot and showed us how to complete steps on the board. I also feel good knowing if I have a bigger problem I could go to office hours.

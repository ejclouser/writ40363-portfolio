    <p>I am currently a senior <i>Criminal Justice Major and DCDA minor</i>. I am an avid sports fan who attends practically every <em>Football, Baseball, and Basketball</em> game played at TCU. I am in Beta Upsilon Chi fraternity, and play club baseball as part of campus activities. After <strong>graduating from TCU</strong> I plan on joining a local law enforcement agency as a police officer, and gain experience in the <i>Criminal Justice</i> word as a way to possibly join a Federal Law enforcement agency when I am old enough.</p>

    <h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>

    <p>Outside of school I have a good few interests. At the top of the list would be fishing and sports. I am an avid fisherman, I find it to be very fun and relaxing, and I love watching/playing sports both college sports and professional sports. I also love traveling especially with friends or family, I have mainly only travelled to different parts of the United States but I am actually looking forward to going to Argentina this Winter.</p>

    <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

    <p>I needed this class for my DCDA minor, so this class does check a box I need. However I am also looking forward to this class because my other DCDA classes have been very interesting to me and I have enjoyed learning so much from them. I have taken a class with Dr. Rode before, and I really enjoyed that experience so that was a factor in choosing this course as well. I like how we are going to focus on Web Applications as that is an important skill to have in todays world.</p>

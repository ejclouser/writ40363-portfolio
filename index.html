            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently a senior Criminal Justice Major and DCDA minor. I am an avid sports fan who attends practically every Football, Baseball, and Basketball game played at TCU. I am in Beta Upsilon Chi fraternity, and play club baseball as part of campus activities. After graduating from TCU I plan on joining a local law enforcement agency as a police officer, and gain experience in the Criminal Justice world as a way to possibly join a Federal Law enforcement agency when I am old enough.</p>
            <p>Outside of school I have a good few interests. At the top of the list would be fishing and sports. I am an avid fisherman, I find it to be very fun and relaxing, and I love watching/playing sports both college sports and professional sports. I also love traveling, especially with friends or family, I have mainly only travelled to different parts of the United States but I am actually looking forward to going to Argentina this Winter.</p>

        <h2>Word from the creator</h2>
        <p>
            The creation of this personal portfolio was an exciting opportunity for me. I have always felt that site creation is a perfect storm of how I can incorporate so many of the various skills I have had the pleasure of learning in my DCDA classes. I want this page to act as an introduction to who I am, what I have done, and what I want to do in the future. While also displaying my current wed design and development abilities. With all that being said, I look forward to learning so much more in this class to continue to improve on this site and others I create in the future. If you have any recommendations or questions please feel free to reach out to me using the contact form below.
        </p>

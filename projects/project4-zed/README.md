# Project Zed: AI-Assisted Web Application

## Overview

Project Zed is an ambitious web application built with AI as a development partner. This project is about **upskilling** — taking what I learned in Projects 1-3 and pushing beyond with AI assistance to develop deeper understanding of web application development.

The goal is to develop deeper understanding through ambitious experimentation. The value is in the insight gained through the journey, not whether everything works perfectly. This is documented through reflections on successes, struggles, breakthroughs, and dead ends.

**Key Principle:** A partially-working app with deep reflection is more valuable than a perfect app without understanding. This project values growth over perfection.

## What is "Upskilling with AI"?

Upskilling with AI means:
- Taking techniques from Projects 1-3 and pushing them further
- Learning new approaches through AI collaboration (and struggle!)
- Building features I wasn't confident to tackle before
- Refining code quality and design thinking
- Expanding technical vocabulary and problem-solving
- Gaining insight from both successes and failures

This is **not** about:
- Having a perfectly polished, bug-free app
- Copying code from AI without understanding
- Building something completely unrelated to the course
- Letting AI do all the work
- Avoiding challenges instead of learning from them

## Project Scope

Build a new web application that demonstrates upskilled techniques from the course. This is a completely new app—not an enhancement of Projects 1-3.

### Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with modern features)
- JavaScript ES6+
- [Additional technologies to be specified]

### Key Techniques Demonstrated

#### From Project 1 (HTML/CSS Foundations) - Upskilled:
- [ ] Advanced CSS animations and transitions
- [ ] CSS Grid or Flexbox layouts beyond basic grids
- [ ] Custom CSS properties (variables) for theming
- [ ] Responsive design with 3+ breakpoints
- [ ] Advanced typography and design systems

#### From Project 2 (JavaScript Fundamentals) - Upskilled:
- [ ] Complex DOM manipulation patterns
- [ ] Event delegation and advanced event handling
- [ ] Data structures beyond simple arrays/objects
- [ ] Form validation and error handling
- [ ] Modular JavaScript (multiple files, separation of concerns)

#### From Project 3 (APIs & Advanced JS) - Upskilled:
- [ ] Working with real external APIs
- [ ] Advanced async patterns (Promise.all, error handling, retry logic)
- [ ] Complex state management across components
- [ ] Data visualization or processing
- [ ] Progressive enhancement

#### New Techniques (Learned via AI):
- [ ] New CSS features (container queries, has(), modern selectors)
- [ ] New JavaScript methods or patterns
- [ ] Accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard navigation, screen reader testing)
- [ ] Performance optimization techniques
- [ ] Modern development practices

## Setup Instructions

[Setup instructions to be added as project develops]

## Project Features

[Features to be documented as the project progresses]

## AI Collaboration

This project was developed with AI assistance. See [`AI_COLLABORATION_LOG.md`](./AI_COLLABORATION_LOG.md) for:
- Tools and AI assistants used
- Key learning moments and challenges
- Debugging sessions and concept explanations
- Process evolution and prompting improvements
- Sample conversations demonstrating the collaboration process

## Code Understanding

I am able to explain every line of code in this project, including:
- How AI-generated code was modified to fit project needs
- Concepts researched after AI introduction
- Code written entirely myself vs. AI-assisted code

## Developer Reflection

See [`REFLECTION.md`](./REFLECTION.md) for in-depth reflection on:
- What I built and why
- Skills from Projects 1-3 that I upskilled
- How AI changed my development process
- Surprises about working with AI
- What I would do differently next time
- How my confidence as a developer has changed

## Credits

- AI Assistance: [Claude, GitHub Copilot, and/or other tools used]
- Course: WRIT 40363 - Writing in the Digital Arts
- Instructor: TCU DCDA

## Due Date

December 10, 2025

## Portfolio Integration

This project is integrated into my final portfolio (Project 1) with consistent design and navigation across all projects.
